    "This is a demonstartion of how you can use JSON-LD to standardise the presentation of metadata that is independent of how the data is serialised in a JSON document. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an intro to JSON-LD see here https://json-ld.org. If you thought the Semantic Web is just some academic fantasy, check out how all the search engines use JSON-LD to extract metadata from the web to build their knowledge graphs https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data. JSON-LD essentially gives you a mechanisms to assign semantics to concepts in a JSON document. We can use ontologies as a mechanism to precisely define those semantics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take \"Organ\" as a concept. We know that in HCA this is an important concept. Despite all the revisions of the HCA schema, the concept of organ has remained the same, even if where it sits in a JSON hierarchy or which schema was defined in has changed. JSON-LD gives us a mechanism to describe a concept like “Organ” independently of how we choose to represent it in a JSON document. Another way to think about it is that we can assign stable ids to fields in the schema, the field names may change even when the concept id stays the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s some examples. We use a new reserved JSON-LD keyword to define a context for our JSON. The context is used to map fields to ontology terms. Here was say organ maps to the UBERON ontology concept for organ. Here’s a simplified bit of sample json. "
